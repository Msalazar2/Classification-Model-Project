# Classification-Model-Project
The purpose of this model is to predict customer churn at Telco.

My goal is to find specific features that drive customer churn at Telco.

1. initial hypotheses and/or questions you have of the data, ideas

Null Hypothesis: A specific feature does not drive customers to churn
Alternative Hypothesis: A specific feature does drive customers to churn

2. data dictionary(explain what each feature represents)

3. project planning (lay out your process through the data science pipeline)

Planning:
- Generate questions to ask about the data set based off of what I want my model to predict. It should predict customer churn.
- Determine the format. Final report should be in .ipynb, Modules should be in .py, Predictions should be in .csv.
- Determine audience and develop speech and presention accordingly. Audience will be lead data scientist.
- Determine correlation between features and customer churn
- Develop my null hypothsisis and alternative hypothesis.
- Determine what model to create
  
Acquisition:
- Using a function with my credentials stored in a env.py file, I connected to codeup's MySQL server.
- Generate a query pertinent to the project
- Using a deliverable I created, I called a function I built to acquire and read telco data from codeup's MySQL server.

4. instructions or an explanation of how someone else can reproduce your project and findings (What would someone need to be able to recreate your project on their own?)

Enviroment setup: Conda, Python, MySql

6. key findings, recommendations, and takeaways from your project
