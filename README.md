# Classification-Model-Project
The purpose of this model is to predict customer churn

My goal is to find specific features that drive customer churn at Telco

initial hypotheses and/or questions you have of the data, ideas

Null Hypothesis: 
Alternative Hypothesis:

data dictionary(explain what each feature represents)

project planning (lay out your process through the data science pipeline)

instructions or an explanation of how someone else can reproduce your project and findings (What would someone need to be able to recreate your project on their own?)

key findings, recommendations, and takeaways from your project
